When I shared this project in my school facebook group and seeked for anyone to test it, one of group member said that
he would not test it as a person making media for living. He also shared the above link to me and suggested me to read
it. **YES ! HE IS RIGHT !** He makes me realise that I have to tell anyone intending to use my program not to use it for
evil things. 

My purpose of writting this program is to facilitate people's life. As a person who spends over 50% of daily time 
on Internet, I always wanna store some fantasic contents locally like youtube tutorial. And I think I am not the only
one. So it makes me write this and share on github.
